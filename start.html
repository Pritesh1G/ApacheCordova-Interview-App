      Before you start any interview, remember these few tips, it contains everything from preparation and etiquette you should follow before and throughout the interview.
      For those of you new to technical interviews, the process can seem overwhelming. Interviewers
      throw questions at you, expect you to whip up brilliant algorithms on the spot, and
      then ask you to write beautiful code on a paper. Luckily, everyone else is in the same
      boat, and you’re already working hard to prepare. Good job!
    </p>

      <strong>It's not a VIVA!:</strong> I have seen many candidates try to bullshit their way through an answer, it's not the best course of action when it comes to an interview.
      We have all done it during Viva-voice and it sometimes does work, but, during interviews the interviewer often asks you a tough question and doesn't expect an answer from you.
      With these questions, their aim is to check how honest you are when asked to do something you have little knowledge about remember 'A little knowledge is a dangerous thing'.
      When faced with these question, please answer honestly that you don't know it, bonus points if you engage the interviewer and ask more about the question and make him answer it!
      Do not beat the bush by saying irrelevant answers or asking question that does not make sense. When you do this, any interviewer will immediately put negatives in their score card. Saying “NO, I don’t know the answer, I am ready to learn provided the opportunity” will go a long way in an interview.</p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Know Your Resume:</strong> While technical skills are extremely important, that’s no reason to
        neglect your own resume. Make sure to prepare yourself to give a quick summary of any
        project or job you were involved with, and to discuss the hardest and most interesting
        problems you encountered along the day.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          <strong>Never Boast:</strong> We all know it's very tempting when asked about your contribution to the project to discredit your colleagues and tell the interviewer it was
          a one man show. Do not do it! Act like a team player, if you want to boast a little, tell them you played a key role in developing the core functionality and managed the deadlines of the teams
          Arrogance is a red flag, but you still want to make yourself sound impressive. So how do you make yourself sound good without being arrogant? By being specific!
          Specificity means giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation. Consider an example:<br>
          Candidate #1: “I basically did all the hard work for the team.”<br>
          Candidate #2: “I implemented the file system, which was considered one of the most challenging components because …”<br>
          Candidate #2 not only sounds more impressive, but she also appears less arrogant.</p>

          <strong>Don't Memorize Stuff:</strong> While this app offers a representative sample of interview questions, there are still thousands of interview questions out there. Memorizing solutions is not
          a great use of your time. Rather, use this app to explore approaches to problems, to learn new concepts, and to practice your skills. However, I will strive to keep this app updated with as much resource as possible,
          so it requires an active internet connection to load them up</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <strong>Talk out loud:</strong> Interviewers want to understand how you think and approach problems, so talk out loud while you’re solving problems. Let the interviewer see how you’re tackling the problem, and they just might guide you as well.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"> <strong>Communication:</strong> Knowing, alone, isn’t good enough. You’re going to be talking with other technical people, and you’re going to be talking to customers, and sales reps, and Betty from Marketing. You will write something eventually, whether it’s documentation, or a project plan, or a requirements document. The word processor might correct your spelling, but it won’t correct your lousy writing. The ability to communicate thoughts and ideas, in a clear, concise manner, is an absolutely invaluable skill that employers seek.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Sell yourself as reliable:</strong> Your potential future team members need to know that they can rely on you. And they need to know that you won’t need constant supervision and hand-holding. They need to know that you’re able to figure things out on your own. One of the most important messages that you, as a candidate, can convey in your interview is hiring me will make your lives easier.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Act Professionally, but not too much:</strong> Nobody is saying that you have to be a bland, boring robot in a suit and tie. Remember, the interview team wants you to be “the one”, but they’re also very worried about the possibility that you’re going to be more of a distraction than an asset. Don’t talk or behave in a way that will set off their early warning radar. Whether or not somebody bothers to behave professionally during an interview is often a very good indicator of what kind of teammate they’re going to be.
            Rudimentary social skills are part of the answer to “Would I have a beer with this guy?”, or at least, “Will I mind working next to this guy for six months?” From the interviewer’s point of view, they’re picking a neighbor that they’re going to live and work with 200 hours per month for foreseeable future. Would you really want a neighbor that smelled like a hog rendering plant?</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>6 project related questions you must learn:</strong>
            Most Challenging, What You Learned, Most Interesting, Hardest Bug, Enjoyed Most, Conflicts with Teammates</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Selling your Weakness as a positive:</strong> When asked about your weaknesses, give a real weakness! Answers like “My greatest weakness is that I work too hard / am a perfectionist / etc” tell your interviewer that you’re arrogant and/or won’t admit to your faults. No one wants to work with someone like that. A better answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it. For example: “Sometimes, I don’t have a very good attention to detail. While that’s good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work.”</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Asking the right questions:</strong> Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask them questions. The quality of your questions will be a factor, whether subconsciously or consciously, in their decisions. Doing research on the company or team may help you with preparing questions.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Algorithms List:</strong>
            Most interviewers won’t ask about specific algorithms for binary tree balancing or other complex algorithms. Frankly, they probably don’t remember these algorithms either.
            You’re usually only expected to know the basics. Here’s a list of the absolute must-have knowledge:
            <ul>
              <li>Linked Lists</li>
              <li>Breadth First Search</li>

            <li>  Singleton Design Pattern</li>
            <li>  Tries</li>
            <li>  Binary Search</li>
            <li>  Factory Design Pattern</li>

            <li>  Merge Sort</li>
            <li>  Memory (Stack vs Heap)</li>

             <li>Hash Tables</li>
            </ul></p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>Five Steps to a Technical Questions:</strong>
            A technical interview question can be solved utilizing a five step approach:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.</li>
              <li>Design an Algorithm</li>
              <li>Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you’re writing pseudo-code! Otherwise, he/she may think that you’re never planning to write “real” code, and many interviewers will hold that against you.</li>
              <li>Write your code, not too slow and not too fast.</li>
              <li>Test your code (if you are provided with the machine) and carefully fix any mistakes.</li>
            </ol></p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>What language should you use:</strong> Many people will tell you “whatever language you’re most comfortable with,” but ideally you want to use a language that your interviewer is comfortable with. I’d usually recommend coding in either C, C++ or Java, as the vast majority of interviewers will be comfortable in one of these languages. My personal preference for interviews is Java (unless it’s a question requiring C / C++), because it’s quick to write and almost everyone can read and understand Java, even if they code mostly in C++.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><strong>You are ready!</strong> Keep these tips in mind and most importantly be confident, walk in the interview like you already know the interviewer and you can tackle whatever he throws at you. I will try to keep the knowledge in this app updated whenever possible. Could you please take one minute of your time to rate this app on the Play store? This would really give me a great incentive to keep providing such great information and will help other students as well.
