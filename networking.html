It is then translated back or decrypted back to its normal readable format using a secret key or password. Encryption help ensure that information that is intercepted halfway would remain unreadable because the user has to have the correct password or key for it.<br><br>83) How are IP addresses arranged and displayed?<br><br>IP addresses are displayed as a series of four decimal numbers that are separated by period or dots. Another term for this arrangement is the dotted decimal format. An example is 192.168.101.2<br><br>84) Explain the importance of authentication.<br><br>Authentication is the process of verifying a user’s credentials before he can log into the network. It is normally performed using a username and password. This provides a secure means of limiting the access from unwanted intruders on the network.<br><br>85) What do mean by tunnel mode?<br><br>This is a mode of data exchange wherein two communicating computers do not use IPSec themselves. Instead, the gateway that is connecting their LANs to the transit network creates a virtual tunnel that uses the IPSec protocol to secure all communication that passes through it.<br><br>86) What are the different technologies involved in establishing WAN links?<br><br>Analog connections – using conventional telephone lines; Digital connections – using digital-grade telephone lines; switched connections – using multiple sets of links between sender and receiver to move data.<br><br>87) What is one advantage of mesh topology?<br><br>In the event that one link fails, there will always be another available.
