Blank rows are left at the specified side by joining tables in other side.<br>Other joins are CROSS JOINs, NATURAL JOINs, EQUI JOIN and NON-EQUI JOIN.<br><br>29)  What do you mean by Index hunting?<br><br>Indexes help in improving the speed as well as the query performance of database. The procedure of boosting the collection of indexes is named as Index hunting.<br><br>30)   How does Index hunting help in improving query performance?<br><br>Index hunting helps in improving the speed as well as the query performance of database. The followed measures are achieved to do that:<br><br>The query optimizer is used to coordinate the study of queries with the workload and the best use of queries suggested based on this.<br>Index, query distribution along with their performance is observed to check the effect.<br>Tuning databases to a small collection of problem queries is also recommended.<br>31)   Enlist the disadvantages of query.<br><br>The disadvantages of query are:<br><br>No indexes<br>Stored procedures are excessively compiled.<br>Triggers and procedures are without SET NOCOUNT ON.<br>Complicated joins making up inadequately written query.<br>Cursors and temporary tables showcase a bad presentation.<br>32)   Enlist ways to efficiently code transactions.<br><br>Ways to efficiently code transactions:<br><br>User input should not be allowed while transactions.<br>While browsing, transactions must not be opened of data.<br>Transactions must be kept as small as possible.<br>Lower transaction segregation levels.<br>Least information of data must be accessed while transacting.<br>33)  What is Executive Plan?<br><br>Executive plan can be defined as:<br><br>SQL Server caches collected procedure or the plan of query execution and used thereafter by subsequent calls.<br>An important feature in relation to performance enhancement.<br>Data execution plan can be viewed textually or graphically.<br>34)  Define B-trees.<br><br>A data structure in the form of tree which stores sorted data and searches, insertions, sequential access and deletions are allowed in logarithmic time.<br><br>35)   Differentiate Table Scan from Index Scan.<br><br>Iterating over all the table rows is called Table Scan while iterating over all the index items is defined as Index Scan.<br><br>36)   What do you mean by Fill Factor concept with respect to indexes?<br><br>Fill Factor can be defined as being that value which defines the percentage of left space on every leaf-level page that is to be packed with data. 100 is the default value of Fill Factor.<br><br> 37)  Define Fragmentation.<br><br>Fragmentation can be defined as a database feature of server that promotes control on data which is stored at table level by the user.<br><br>38)   Differentiate Nested Loop, Hash Join and Merge Join.<br><br>Nested loop (loop over loop)<br><br>An outer loop within an inner loop is formed consisting of fewer entries and then for individual entry, inner loop is individually processed.<br><br>E.g.<br><br>Select col1.*, col2.* from coll, col2 where coll.col1=col2.col2;<br>It’s processing takes place in this way:<br><br>For i in (select * from col1) loop<br>For j in (select * from col2 where col2=i.col1) loop<br>Results are displayed;<br>End of the loop;<br>End of the loop;<br><br>The Steps of nested loop are:<br><br>Identify outer (driving) table<br>Assign inner (driven) table to outer table.<br>For every row of outer table, access the rows of inner table.<br>Nested Loops is executed from the inner to the outer as:<br><br>outer_loop<br>inner_loop<br>Hash join<br>While joining large tables, the use of Hash Join is preferred.<br><br>Algorithm of Hash Join is divided into:<br><br>Build: It is a hash table having in-memory which is present on the smaller table.<br>Probe: this hash value of the hash table is applicable for each second row element.<br>Sort merge join<br>Two independent sources of data are joined in sort merge join. They performance is better as compared to nested loop when the data volume is big enough but it is not good as hash joins generally.<br>The full operation can be divided into parts of two:<br><br>Sort join operation :<br><br>Get first row R1 from input1<br><br>Get first row R2 from input2.<br><br>Merge join operation:<br><br>‘while’ is not present at either loop’s end.<br>if R1 joins with R2<br>next row is got R2 from the input 2<br>return (R1, R2)<br>else if R1 < style=””> next row is got from R1 from input 1<br>else<br>next row is got from R2 from input 2<br>end of the loop<br>39)  What is Database partitioning?<br><br>Division of logical database into independent complete units for improving its management, availability and performance is called Database partitioning.<br><br>40) Explain the importance of partitioning.<br><br>Splitting of one table which is large into smaller database entities logically is called database partitioning. Its benefits are:<br><br>To improve query performance in situations dramatically when mostly rows which are heavily accessed are in one partition.<br>Accessing large parts of a single partition<br>Slower and cheaper storage media can be used for data which is seldom used.<br>41)   Define Database system.<br><br>DBMS along with database is called Database system.<br><br>42) What do you mean by Query Evaluation Engine?<br><br>Query Evaluation Engine executes the low-level instructions that are generated by the compiler.<br><br>43)  Define DDL Interpreter.<br><br>DDL statements are interpreted and recorded in tables called metadata.<br><br>44)  Define Atomicity and Aggregation.<br><br>Atomicity: It’s an all or none concept which enables the user to be assured of incomplete transactions to be taken care of.
